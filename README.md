## ‚ú® Overview

This project delivers a robust, SQL-based solution for efficient warehouse dataset querying and comprehensive inventory management. It tackles critical challenges such as preventing stockouts, mitigating overstocking, optimizing reordering processes, and providing data-driven insights for warehouse operations. By leveraging advanced SQL queries and a meticulously designed database schema, this project aims to:

*   **Optimize Inventory Levels:** Achieve the perfect balance to meet demand without excess.
*   **Streamline Supply Chain:** Enhance the flow of goods from supplier to customer.
*   **Boost Operational Efficiency:** Improve overall warehouse productivity and decision-making.

## üöÄ Features & Accomplishments

### 1. üóÑÔ∏è Database Design and Optimization

*   **Normalized Schema:** Designed and implemented a normalized relational database schema to accurately represent all facets of warehouse data, including products, suppliers, stock levels, and order information.
*   **Performance Indexing:** Applied strategic indexing to key tables and columns, significantly optimizing query performance and ensuring rapid data retrieval for critical operations.

    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **Explore the Schema:** [schema](https://github.com/Sanidhya-Sehgal/Store_Management/tree/main/schema)

### 2. üîç Advanced SQL Querying

*   Developed a comprehensive suite of advanced SQL queries to address vital inventory management tasks:
    *   **Stock Optimization:** Queries to intelligently identify optimal stock levels, minimizing both costly overstocking and disruptive stockouts.
    *   **Reorder Detection:** An automated system for proactively identifying products that require reordering based on predefined thresholds and historical demand patterns.
    *   **Demand Forecasting Support:** Queries specifically designed to extract and analyze historical data patterns, providing invaluable input for more accurate demand prediction models.
    *   **Supplier Performance Analysis:** Generated insightful reports to evaluate supplier efficiency, reliability, and impact on the supply chain.
    *   **Product Movement Analysis:** Tracked and analyzed product movement to identify fast-moving, slow-moving, and stagnant items, informing merchandising and storage strategies.

## üåç Societal Impact

*   **Contributed to sustainable retail practices by optimizing stock levels, significantly reducing waste from overstocking, and ensuring consistent product availability to meet consumer demand.** This project empowers businesses to operate more responsibly, minimizing their environmental footprint while simultaneously enhancing customer satisfaction and community well-being.

## üìÅ Project Structure

*   `data_import_and_export/`: Contains Python scripts for importing data from CSV files and potentially for exporting analytical results.
*   `queries/`: Houses all the SQL queries developed for in-depth data analysis, inventory optimization, and comprehensive report generation.
*   `schema/`: Defines the complete database schema, including `CREATE TABLE` statements and the intricate relationships between tables.
*   `README.md`: This comprehensive project documentation file, providing an overview and guide.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **SQL**
*   (If you used a specific DBMS, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, add it here. For example: `MySQL`)

## üöÄ How to Use/Set Up

To set up and run this project locally, follow these straightforward steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sanidhya-Sehgal/Store_Management.git](https://github.com/Sanidhya-Sehgal/Store_Management.git)
    cd Store_Management
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have a SQL database system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
    *   Execute the SQL scripts located in the `schema/` directory to create all the necessary database tables.

3.  **Import Data:**
    *   Place your raw CSV data files (e.g., `reorder_points.csv`, `products.csv`, etc.) in the appropriate directory within the cloned repository.
    *   Run the Python scripts found in `data_import_and_export/` to efficiently import your data into the newly created database tables.

4.  **Run Queries:**
    *   Execute the SQL queries from the `queries/` directory using your preferred SQL client. This will allow you to perform various analyses, generate insightful reports, and observe the powerful inventory management functionalities in action.
